## Orchestra
> Attention: At the moment, this Node.js module is only a proof of concept. It is still alpha stage.
Orchestra is a distributed retrieval framework written in TypeScript/JavaScript. At the moment, this project is separated in two different packages. The first is called Maestro, which creates database jobs from the queries. The second is called Muso that consumes the jobs generated by the Maestro and performs queries on the databases.

Orchestra supports any database model as a data basis, but at the moment it exists wrappers for SQL Databases. Other models can be used by implementing your own Orchestra-Database-wrapper.

## Requirements
Orchestra has a few requirements:
* Node.js
* Redis

## Configuration

## Run Orchestra
